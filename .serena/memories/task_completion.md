# Task Completion Checklist

When a task is completed, perform the following steps to ensure quality:

1.  **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to catch any potential errors or style violations.
2.  **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` to ensure the application builds successfully without errors.
3.  **Manual Verification**:
    - If UI changes were made, verify them in the browser (or Electron if applicable).
    - Check for any console errors.
4.  **Documentation**:
    - Update `project_memory.md` if significant architectural changes or new features were added.
    - Update `README.md` if installation or usage instructions changed.
